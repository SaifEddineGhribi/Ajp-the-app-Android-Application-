# Ajp-the-app-Android-Application-
Summer 2017 - An android application for the association : Association des jeunes polytechniciens. A personal project(summer holidays) to learn Android and especially to try the Google FireBase API.

Android Studio was used to create this application. <br>

The purpose of this application is to give members of the association the possibility to specify how much they spent and all the informations of their missions. The administration of the association can afterwards refund them and have a realtime idea about all the ongoing missions.<br>
